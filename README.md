Exploring and applying data science techniques to Titanic Ship Case Study dataset


Titanic Ship Case Study
Problem Description: On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding
with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.
  - One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not
  enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
  - Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of
  people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-
  class.

The problem associated with the Titanic dataset is to predict whether a passenger survived the
disaster or not. The dataset contains various features such as passenger class, age, gender,
cabin, fare, and whether the passenger had any siblings or spouses on board. These features can
be used to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving the
disaster. The dataset offers opportunities for feature engineering, data visualization, and model
selection, making it a valuable resource for developing and testing data analysis and machine
learning skills.
